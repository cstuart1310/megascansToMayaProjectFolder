# megascansToMayaProjectFolder
Just a python script which moves all texture assets in a maya scene that are being used from a megascans downloads folder to the sourceimages folder, as well as changing the file paths so it links to the new directory automatically

Base of the code comes from this thread https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/maya-forum/easy-way-to-relocate-textures-to-current-project/td-p/6542378, however I've changed it to use folders instead of dumping everything into the sourceimages folder, as well as other improvements.
